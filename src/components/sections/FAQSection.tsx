    question: "How will the rooms be assigned to me?",
    answer: "Rooms will be assigned on a Twin - Sharing basis. Which means you will be sharing a room with another awesome Reset attendee. Shared energy, and connection is a part of the Reset process & experience. Also, as rooms are limited, single rooms are not an option."
  },
  {
    question: "How will my roommate be chosen?",
    answer: "Gender-matched and curator-paired. No roommate requests."
  },
  {
    question: "Attending with a spouse or 14+ child?",
    answer: "Book two seats (â‚¹ 20k + GST each) and we'll room you together."
  },
  {
    question: "Can my kids attend Reset as well?",
    answer: "We love kids learning early in their life definitely. But this event is going to be an intense event, and some immersion isn't designed for young kids. 14+ Year olds can definitely be a part of Reset. You can purchase a ticket for them. This event will NOT BE SUITABLE for kids younger than 14."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the fee refundable?",
    answer: "No. Your payment blocks a room and meal plan with the hotel."
  },
  {
    question: "What time should I be there at the Venue?",
    answer: "Please book your tickets in a way that you reach Bangalore on 3rd October late morning, please reach the venue by 1:30 PM. Please make sure that you've completed your lunch and you reach Leroy Grand because the Registration and Event will get started right away!"
  },
  {
    question: "When can I book my tickets to go back home after Reset?",
    answer: "Please book your travel tickets to go back home for after 10:30 PM on 6th October (Monday) because we don't want you to rush after the event, or get stuck in traffic and miss your bus / train / flight. 10:30 PM would give you plenty of time to complete your last day peacefully, and reach your station / airport without missing any part of your experience"
